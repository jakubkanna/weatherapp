# Weather App

**Note:** Yes you don't see a stylesheet for a reason! The goal is to create good design and the app using only default user agent stylesheet.

## The Odin Project

### Project: Weather App

#### JavaScript Course

##### Assignment

- Set up a blank HTML document with the appropriate links to your JavaScript and CSS files.
- Write the functions that hit the API. Create functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. For now, just use `console.log()` to display the information.
- Write functions that process the JSON data you get from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.
- Set up a simple form that lets users input their location and fetches the weather info (still just using `console.log()` for now).
- Display the information on your webpage!
- Add any styling you like!
- _Optional:_ Add a 'loading' component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API. Use DevTools to test for low-end devices.
- Push your code to GitHub and share your solution below!
